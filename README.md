  üõçÔ∏è Machine Learning eCommerce Recommender System
</h4>

## Overview

RetailBox is a recommender system that uses machine learning to make recommendations based off of a user's past purchase history. This project was inspired by Amazon and their recommender system techology.

## Dataset

The dataset we used is the [UCI Online Retail Dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/online+retail). This dataset has 25900 transactions, with each transaction containing 20 features, and these transactions were made by 4,300 users.

Here are the features of the dataset:

* Invoice No
* Stock Code
* Description
* Quantity
* UnitPrice
* CustomerID
* Country

## Training/Test Split

The way we split the data was by time.

## Algorithms Used

* SGD Matrix Factorization
* Recurrent Neural Networks

## Performance Measures

We set a baseline measurement for our recommender system, and then compared it to a recommender system that used matrix factorization and RNNs.
Baseline

SGD Matrix Factorization

RNN

The RNN performed the best.

## Challenge and Workarounds

* Dataset had several rows of a single transactions
* We don't know what the user doesn't like.
* Matrix Factorization does not take

## Context of Recommendation Scenario

In this recommender system, the context we used can be seen by the diagram below. Our main model to generate recommendations for a user and if a user bought an item our system recommended, then it was a success!
